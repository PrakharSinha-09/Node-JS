REST API are basically the principles or standards that should be followed while designig the APIs
It could be understood as the standards that should be followed : it says

1. One Should effectively follow the communication between client and server like when server side rendering of the response must be sent or client
side rendering things happen..
Like When you are sure that your client will always be browsers then in that case, you should go for sever side rendering (i.e., directly send HTML) otherwise
lets say for any other client like mobile app requesting the data, or smart devices like alexa requestingm, in that case one should'nt go for SSR because 
you don't know how to render data rather send response in JSON or XML format and then it will be rendered at client end accordingly!

2. One should respect all http methods, like you should use http methods for what purpose they are made for
for example lets say you want to delete the data from the database, you can do it via POST/DELETE/PATCH/PUT but for the standard, you should use DELETE
