What We have to do is the following

design a REST API for JSON
Remember one thing, always design hybrid APIs means that your api should be working both in mobileapp & browser

You can make something like Get /users , in this case display HTML .... this will be for your browser  --- Server Side Rendering
You can make something like Get /api/users , in this case display JSON .... this will be for your mobile app --- Client Side Rendering

GET /api/users - List all users
GET /api/users/1 - Get the user with ID 1             These will be dynamic routes... because we don't know how many user will be there...
GET /api/users/2 - Get the user with ID 2


POST /api/users - Create A New user

PATCH /api/users/1 -  Edit the user with ID 1

DELETE /api/users/1 - Delete the user with ID 1

for now we don't have a database, so we will be getting the data(json data) from the website named mokaaro.com and perform the above operations
